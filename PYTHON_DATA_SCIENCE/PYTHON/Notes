#  # Introduction of python :-

# Python is dynamically typed language .
# It is general purpose programming language that support object oriented programming.
# Python is interpreted and high level language.
# It was created by  Guido Van Rossum in 1989.
# It is platform independent language too.

# <!-- Modules -->
# Modules are used to borrow the pre written code for using in our program .
# Modules are of two types : 
# -> External Modules
# -> Built in Modules


# # Ternary Operator in Python
#  To check the condition in the python by the ternary operator ,
#     Syntax of ternary operator :

#      result = "boy" if (name = "aayush") else "girl"

# String
# String is a data type that stores a sequence of characters.
# Basic operations : 
# 1. Concatenations  :
#                     => "Hello "+"World" -----> "HelloWorld"

# 2. Length of the String : 
#                     => len(str) 

# 3. Valid form of creating the String : 
#                     => str1 = "String"
#                     => str2 = 'String'
#                     => str3 ="""String"""
#             These are the way to create the String 

# 4. Backslash n () :
#             =>  It is escape sequence character , which is used to change the line inside the String .

# 5. Backslash t (t): 
#             =>  It is used to create distance of atleast 5 per space at once inside the String .
            
# #  Indexing in String :
# a  a  y  u  s  h  p  a  t  e  r  i   y  a
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12  13 14

# str = "aayushpateriya"
# ch=str[2]
# print(ch) # Output: y

# Note : We didnot replace the character of the particular String like that :
#         name = "aayush pateriya"
#         str[6] = "@"  //Like that 
#         print(str)


# <!-- Slicing in python  -->
# If we take the selected character from the String then we will 
# implement the Slicing function in the Python ..
#         str = "Aayush pateriya"
#         str1 = str[1:4]
#         print(str1) //// output:ayu

# If we want to select the all the character of the String from the selected index upto last index .
# than,
#         str = "XansaITSolutions"
#         str2 = str[2:] // str[2:len(str)]
#         print(str2) // output:nsaITSolutions


# <!-- Slicing in negative index  -->
# If we want to index negatively our String backwardly
#   S  h  y  a  m 
#  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1

# # String Functions 
# 1. EndsWith Function :
# str = "I am a coder "
# str.endswith("er")# return  true if the String ends with subString 

# 2. Capitalize() Function 
# 3. Replace() Function 
# 4. Find() Function 
# 5. Count() function 

# # Indentation
# The Indentation is the space given before writting the print statement in the conditional statement .
# The indentation in the python programming is very important .
# For Example :

# name = "aayush"

# if(name=="disha):
#         print("she is a girl")
# elif(name="aayush")
#         print("He is a boy")


# # Nesting Statement 
# The nesting statement is to write the conditional statement inside the conditional statement .
# For example : 
# marks = int(input("Enter the marks of the student))
# if(marks>89 and marks>100):
#         grade="A"
#         if(grade=="A")
#                 print("Give them the prize")
                
# # Lists in Python
#  A built-in data type that stores set of values
#  It can store elements of different types (integer, float, string, etc.)

#  marks = [87, 64, 33, 95, 76]
#  #marks[0], marks[1]..
#  student = [”Karan”, 85, “Delhi”] #student[0], student[1]..
#  student[0] = “Arjun” #allowed in python
#  len(student)
#  apna college     

#  -> We can change the type of the any element inside the list ..
# such that list is also mutable

# # List Slicing
#  Similar to String Slicing
#  list_name[ starting_idx : ending_idx ] #ending idx is not included

#  marks = [87, 64, 33, 95, 76]
#  marks[ 1 : 4 ] is [64, 33, 95]
#  marks[  : 4 ] is same as marks[ 0 : 4]
#  marks[ 1 :  ] is same as marks[ 1 : len(marks) ]
#  marks[ -3 : -1 ] is [33, 95]

# # List Methods
#  list = [2, 1, 3]
#  list.append(4)  #adds one element at the end 
#  list.sort( )
#   #sorts in ascending order 
# [2, 1, 3, 4]
#  [1, 2, 3]

#  list.sort( reverse=True ) 
#   #sorts in descending order 

# list.reverse( )  
# #reverses list 
# [3, 1, 2]
# [3, 2, 1]
# Apna College
# list.insert( idx, el )  #insert element at index

# # Tuples in Python
#  A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values.
#  Tuples is immutable just like String ..

#  2. We will not change the element either with their same data type of element .

# For Example : 
#  tup = (87, 64, 33, 95, 76) #tup[0], tup[1]..
#  tup[0] = 43 #NOT allowed in python
#  tup1 = ( )
#  tup2 = ( 1, )
#  tup3 = ( 1, 2, 3 )

# # Set in Python
# # Set is a collection of the unordered items  .
# # Each Element in the set must be the unique and immutable .
# # The Set is mutable , but the element of the set is immutable .
# # The numbers , String and tuples should be stored in the Sets.


# #  -> How to create empty set 
# collection = {} # This is not the creation of the empty set , It is the 
#                 #creation of the empty dictionary

# collection = set() # creation of empty Set 



# The methods of the Set :
# set.add(el) # it adds the element
# set.remove(el) # it removes a element
# set.clear() #it clear the whole set
# set.pop() # it pop up or remove the first element from the set.
